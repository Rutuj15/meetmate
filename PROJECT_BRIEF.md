## ⚠️ POTENTIAL CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

### Challenge 1: Chrome AI API Availability
**Problem:** Chrome AI APIs are in origin trial, may not be available on all Chrome versions
**Solution:**
- Check API availability on extension load
- Show clear error message with setup instructions
- Provide fallback to cloud mode (Gemini API)
- Document required Chrome version in README

### Challenge 2: Screenshot Capture on Different Platforms
**Problem:** Screen capture permissions vary by OS
**Solution:**
- Request necessary permissions in manifest.json
- Provide clear permission request UI
- Gracefully handle permission denial
- Test on Windows, Mac, Linux

### Challenge 3: Performance Impact During Meetings
**Problem:** AI processing could slow down meeting experience
**Solution:**
- Async processing (don't block UI)
- Throttle screenshot analysis
- Compress images before processing
- Show loading indicators
- Performance budget: < 50MB memory, < 5% CPU

### Challenge 4: Different Meeting Platform UIs
**Problem:** Google Meet and Zoom have different DOM structures
**Solution:**
- Focus on Google Meet for MVP
- Zoom support is bonus (if time permits)
- Abstract platform-specific code into separate injectors
- Content scripts per platform

### Challenge 5: Multimodal API Complexity
**Problem:** Image processing and prompt engineering for visual content
**Solution:**
- Start simple: "Extract text and key points from this image"
- Iterate on prompts based on testing
- Compress images to reduce processing time
- Cache results to avoid reprocessing
